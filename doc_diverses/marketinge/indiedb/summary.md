### Blarg v1.0 sourcecode

http://www.indiedb.com/games/blarg/downloads/blarg-v10-sourcecode

Filename : blarg_sourcecode.zip

Category : Source Code	

Uploader : Recher	

Date : Apr 6th, 2011	

Size : 1.54mb (1,613,446 bytes)

Downloads : 299

MD5 Hash : 0cd877805790576a936ccc6871ff0a1a 

Description :

Here is the long awaited sourcecode for Blarg. The sound, image and fonts are also included. The game is written in python/pygame, so you can execute it on every platform that supports it (Mac, Windows, Linux, ...) You need to have pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.5.msi and python-2.5.4.msi, or earlier version, to launch the game directly from the sourcecode. The entry point is the file "zemain.py". You will also find some instructions to transform this source code in a .app file for Mac, and a .exe file for PC. (These instructions are in French, sorry about that). (Frogs rule). The licence for the code, image and sounds is a double one : Free Art License, and CC-BY-SA. You may choose to use the files under one of these license, or both.

This is the full and final release of Blarg, for Mac. Enjoy ! (And don't forget to download also the source code, if you want to explore it). To install, double-click on the .dmg file, and copy the blarg.app file where you want on your hard drive. If you double-click on the blarg.app directly from the .dmg, before extracting it, the game will work, but nothing will be saved (scores, configuration, ...) So, please, really put it on your hard drive. If you have trouble with the fulscreen display, or if the mouse cursor cannot go everywhere : launch the game with the command "blarg.app FORCE_WINDOWED"
