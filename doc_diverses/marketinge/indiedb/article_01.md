## Shotgun + Magicians = Blarg, a 2D shoot'em up.

**Tons of magicians to kill. Make them burst ! Pure moments of adrenaline and stupid-but-great massacres.**

So, what do we have ?

- Tons of magicians to kill. Make them burst ! Pure moments of adrenaline and stupid-but-great massacres.

- Amazing sound effects. All made with my voice and a microphone. Shotgun firings, yellings, explosions, poo-transformations. Everything is yargled in almost real noises.

- Not-so-random movements and generations of the enemies. An infinity of unpredictable waves that goes harder and harder.

- All the stuff you normally expect in a "real" game : hi-score savings, keys configuration, presentation menu, scenario written on 5 lines, ...

- English and french languages.

- Before releasing the game, I will ask some donations. Depending on how much you give, you will get a special version with god mode, your name in the credits, the possibility to participate to the contents, etc. I will tell you the details when everything is ready. It will be here : [Ulule.com](http://www.ulule.com/)

- When released, the game and its source code will be free (as in free speech AND free beer), available under CreativeCommons-BY-ShareAlike, and Free Art License. It is written in Python, with the Pygame library. And believe me, that's cool.
