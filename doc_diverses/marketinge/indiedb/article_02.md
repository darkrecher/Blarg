## Blarg : get the pre-release version, with the god mode

**Want to play Blarg before everyone else ? Want to kill an infinity of magician, thanks to the awesome "gode mode" ? Well then, approach, friends.**

For a modest fee (give what you want, 1 euro minimum), you will have premium-VIP-golden access to Blarg, and its exclusive gode mode. (This mode will not be available in the public release of the game, so this is your only chance to get it !)

For a teasing video, and all the detailed explanations, (how to pay, how to get the game, ...) follow this link : [Ulule.com](http://www.ulule.com/blarg/)

You have the possibility to get a bunch of other goodies if you choose to pay more than 1 euro :

 - your name/nickname in the credits and a link to your site or your blog.
 
 - a dedication of the presentation picture (dedicated with MS paint and sent by mail, because cheap is smart).
 
 - The chance to get involved in the artistic content of the game, by imitating the noise of a dying magician and sending the sound sample.
 
 - The over-unique chance to get involved in the artistic content and the scenario, by choosing the name of the hero.

Don't wait, tons of magicians are waiting for you to get a shotgun shell in the middle of their face full of spots !
