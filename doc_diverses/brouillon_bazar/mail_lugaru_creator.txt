Brouillon du mail envoyé à Jeffrey Rosen, créateur du jeu Lugaru, pour lui annoncer que j'ai rédigé un test de son jeu dans 42, et pour lui demander de causer de Blarg.

Il m'avait fait une petite réponse rapide et avait donné un euro sur Ulule. \o/ !!

==========================

Hello,


Here is a little message from one of your fan.

My name is Recher. Apart from several other things, I am redactor in a french webzine, called "42", we have about 15000 visitors per months. And I just wanted to tell you I wrote an article about Lugaru, in our issue of January.

If you are not afraid of french language, you can read it here :

To sum up what I wrote in it :
 - I liked the combat system, which has lots of tricks and moves with few buttons.
 - I liked the universe, and the fact that all the creatures are constantly in a precarious situation, constantly surviving.
 - The 3D is old, but it's not a problem.
 - Overgrowth and the whale man.


Because I talked about you and your work to some people, would you mind if I talk a little about me to you ?

I try to be an independant game developper (at my own level). I am currently making a 2D shooter called "Blarg". You have to kill magicians with a shotgun. All the sounds are made with my voice, it rocks (and it solves the problem of finding "foley sounds").

The game content is quite small, and I can not hope selling it to anyone. So it will be available freely, under the licence CC-BY-SA and the Free Art License.

However, I am currently selling a pre-release version, for the people who would be interested. They pay what they want (minimum 1 euro), and they get the game before everyone else. They also get a secret password which gives them access to the god mode.

Some other goodies are offered to people who wants to pay a little more  (their name in the credits, possibility to propose a sound sample, etc.)

You can find a teasing video, images, detailed explanation, and the list of the goodies on this site : http://www.ulule.com/blarg/

And of course, I have lots of other games in my mind. But all of these will be revealed in an undefined future.


Do what you want with all these informations : spread the word, throw me some coins to get your pre-release god-mode-added version, or just pass to the next mail. Anyway, I am happy to have been able to write these words to you, and I really appreciate your games.


Goodbye. Have a good time playing and creating.


Réchèr.
